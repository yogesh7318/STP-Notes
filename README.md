## Why This Repository Exists

Most Git tutorials explain commands.

This lab teaches workflow.

It focuses on how real teams:

* Maintain clean commit history
* Work safely using branches
* Collaborate using Pull Requests
* Use CI pipelines as quality gates
* Recover safely from mistakes

The goal is not theory.
The goal is confidence in real-world development flow.

## What This Covers

The lab progresses from fundamentals to structured team workflow.

### Core Foundations

* Git installation & configuration
* Local repositories & commit discipline
* Understanding staging & diffs

### Collaboration Workflow

* Remote repositories with GitHub
* Branching strategy
* Merging (fast-forward & merge commit)
* Merge conflict resolution

### Team Simulation

* Push & Pull synchronization
* Pull Request lifecycle
* Code review concepts

### CI Automation

* GitHub Actions workflow setup
* Triggering pipelines on push
* Reading CI logs
* Understanding success vs failure signals

### Recovery & Safety

* Undo before commit
* Soft reset vs hard reset
* Using `git reflog` to recover deleted commits
* Understanding HEAD movement

## Lab Structure

The training is structured in two phases:

### Phase 1 – Lab Training

9 focused hands-on lab sessions covering Git workflow end-to-end.

### Phase 2 – Minor Working Project

Students apply:

* Feature branch workflow
* Pull Request merge
* CI enforcement
* Commit recovery demonstration

The project simulates a professional Git flow in a controlled environment.

---

## Tools Used

* Git (Command Line)
* GitHub
* GitHub Actions (CI)
* Git Bash (Windows environment)

No GUI dependency.
No shortcuts.
Pure workflow understanding.

---

## Who This Is For

* Engineering students learning version control
* Beginners transitioning to professional workflows
* Trainers teaching Git & DevOps fundamentals
* Developers who want to clean up their Git habits

---

## Industry Relevance

This lab mirrors real team practices:

* No direct push to main
* Structured Pull Requests
* CI as automated validation
* Clean, readable commit history
* Safe recovery during mistakes

These are the same fundamentals used in production environments.

---

## Outcomes

After completing this lab, a learner can:

* Work confidently with Git from the command line
* Explain branching and merge behavior clearly
* Handle merge conflicts calmly
* Understand when and why CI runs
* Recover from common Git mistakes without panic

---

## Repository Usage

You may:

* Fork this repository for classroom use
* Adapt it for internal DevOps training
* Extend it with advanced CI/CD scenarios

If you find it useful, consider starring the repository.

If you'd like, I can also create:

* A version tailored for recruiters
* A README optimized for portfolio visibility
* Or a badge-enhanced version (CI status, license, etc.)
